## 📖 Project Description

Milestone 1 focuses on building the core authentication system for the PolicyNav application. The objective of this milestone was to implement a secure and functional user management system that allows users to register, log in, recover passwords, and access a dashboard.

The following functionalities were successfully implemented:

- User Registration (Signup Page)
- Secure Login System
- Password Hashing using bcrypt
- JWT-based Authentication
- Forgot Password functionality with Security Question validation
