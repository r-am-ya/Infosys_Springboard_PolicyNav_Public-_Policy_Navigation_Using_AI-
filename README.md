Public Policy Navigation Using AI PolicyNav is an AI-driven platform designed to simplify the navigation and analysis of complex public policy documents. 

By utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs), this tool transforms dense regulatory texts into searchable, actionable intelligence. 

📌 Project Overview 
- Navigating public policy often requires manual review of hundreds of pages.
- PolicyNav automates this process through:
- Semantic Search: Finding relevant policy sections based on intent, not just keywords.
- Intelligent Summarization: Condensing long regulations into high-level summaries.
- Compliance Checking: Using AI assistants to verify if specific scenarios align with current policies.
- Entity Extraction: Automatically identifying stakeholders, dates, and legal citations.
